# Walrus

`Walrus.jl` is a Julia package providing various closures models (closure -> seal -> seal ðŸ¦­ -> walrus) for ocean flavoured fluid dynamics with [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/).

Currently, it includes:
- `WallStress`: a wall stress model for LES
- `TidalForcing`: simple body forcing to replicate tides
- `RadiativeHeating`: a simple radiative transfer model that imparts a body heating
