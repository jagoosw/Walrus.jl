``Walrus.jl`` is a Julia package providing various closures models (closure -> seal -> seal ðŸ¦­ -> walrus) for ocean flavoured fluid dynamics with [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/).

Currently, it includes:
- `WallStress`: a wall stress model for LES
- `TidalForcing`: simple body forcing to replicate tides
- `RadiativeHeating`: a (very) simple radiative transfer model that imparts a body heating
- `WindStress`: a bulk formulation for wind stress
- `SurfaceHeatExchange`: a bulk formulation for heat exchange at the ocean surface

Limited documentaiton is available [here](http://walrus.jagosw.com/dev/).

To-do:
- Add automated testing
